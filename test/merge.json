                        "studies.challenge": "For many years since launch, a UK Mobile Network Operator suffered from the highest churn and worst Net Promoter Score (NPS) in the market. It also had very high negative word-of-mouth from customers due to poor network experience and customer service. This resulted in poor brand perception which had become a handbrake for growth due to high levels of brand rejection – i.e. customers weren’t even considering the brand.",
                        "studies.work": "We took an insight-led approach that centred around the dynamics and economics of Net Promoter Score. We developed a unique NPS and churn propensity model based on combining customer insight with underlying experience data. We then used linear regression techniques so we were able to show where the greatest impact on customer experience was happening – and so were able to prioritise the company’s resources in the most optimal way. We leveraged the model to optimise proactive interventions for how and where the operator should launch a series of material improvements through a portfolio of customer solutions, customer communication, customer journey design and co-creation.",
                        "studies.outcome": "The work created an uplift of +25% point in Net Promoter Score over a 4 year period. This made this UK mobile operator the best in the market. Churn reduced 30% during same the period; bringing into line with its competitors. Overall, this work created a much stronger foundation for the business to further grow its customer base profitably – resulting in it seeing its reported net profit (EBIT) improve five-fold during the same period.",
